# From the data mess to the data mesh, part 0

I've recently participated in several online and offline events
to learn how other companies improve their way of managing analytics
and data inside the organisation.

All of them were relatively big companies or massive enterprises.

This article is my understanding of what is happening
with the adoption of the "Data Mesh" concept nowadays.

## How do companies understand "Data Mesh"?

Let's start with a simple definition of "Data Mesh".

Data mesh is a strategy for a *data-driven* company
to change the way the company operates on different levels.

Data Mesh changes the culture of a company. It brings fresh
air to a company's structure. It redefines the architecture of
the systems operating with data and defines
new engineering standards.

So far, I see the stakeholders' interpretation of these statements
as something close to

> You know, we have a radical approach. And it will hurt the first time.
> If you want to operate better, you better use this approach.

Let's take a different angle of view, look again at the Data Mesh
as a concept, and see that Data Mesh is an idea,
an intellectual product.

If you want to sell any product, you need to pitch it
to the investors, develop it, promote it, and only
then get the actual value. It is a long journey, isn't it?

In this article I want to discuss every foundamental principle
of the Data Mesh from the product side and pitching side.

### Domain ownership of the data

Data Mesh is saying: **decentralize the ownership of analytical**
**data to business domains closest to the data**. And then
the concept is saying **either source of the data or its main**
**consumers**.

Originally, for the book "Data Mesh. Delivering Data-Driven Value at Scale"
by Zhamak Dehghani:

> Data Mesh, as its core, is founded in decentralisation and
> distribution of data responsibility to people who are
> closest to the data.

For me, a person who works with data, perform analytics, and
runs machine learning models on a daily basis, it is a great
approach.

But how can I convince the rest of the organisation that this
approach is really feasible?

Let's talk about "domain ownership", what does it mean and how
we should pitch this principle.

In short, domain ownership means product ownership. If you start
to treat your data as a product, then you start applying
product development principles to it.
