# From the data mess to the data mesh, part 0

I've recently participated in several online and offline events
to learn how other companies improve their way of managing analytics
and data inside the organisation.

All of them were relatively big companies or massive enterprises.

This article is my understanding of what is happening
with the adoption of the "Data Mesh" concept nowadays.

## How do companies understand "Data Mesh"?

Let's start with a simple definition of "Data Mesh".

Data mesh is a strategy for a *data-driven* company
to change the way the company operates on different levels.

Data Mesh changes the culture of a company. It brings fresh
air to a company's structure, redefines the architecture of
the systems operating with data, and defines engineering standards.

So far, I see the stakeholders' interpretation of these statements
as something close to

> You know, we have a radical approach.
> If you want to operate better,
> you better use this approach.

Let's take a different angle of view, look again at the Data Mesh
as a concept, and see that Data Mesh is an idea,
an intellectual product.

If you want to sell any product, you need to pitch it
to the investors, develop it, promote it, and only
then get the actual value. It is a long journey, isn't it?
