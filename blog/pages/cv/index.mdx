# Nikita Barskov, Data and ML Engineer

You can reach me via email [nbarskov@proton.me](mailto:nbarskov@proton.me)
or [nbarskov@duck.com](mailto:nbarskov@duck.com) in English, Norwegian or
Russian.

## Summary

I am a software engineer based in Oslo, specialising in data,
data analysis and machine learning.

I hold a master's degree in Computer Science and Data Analysis
and a bachelor's degree in Applied Physics and Mathematics.

In my career, the majority of the time, I worked as a full-stack
data specialist.

I have five and half years of experience in different industries:
programmatic advertisement, oil and gas, and retail.
I am familiar with a wide range of technologies and approaches:

-   Dev- and ML- Ops: I have experience working at the Analytics Platform Team,
    enabling data scientists and data analysts and adopting the Data Mesh,
-   Public Cloud : I primarily worked with Google Cloud Platform and
    partially Azure using Infrastructure as Code with Terraform,
-   Data engineering: data modelling (I used protobuf), consuming (I wrote
    pipelines in Python), transforming (I used dbt) and serving (via analytical
    database such as BigQuery),
-   Data analytics and analysis: I've been analysing the data and delivering
    machine learning models.

I always seek challenging and rewarding opportunities to leverage my expertise in product development.

I am focusing on staying up-to-date with the latest developments and practices in the data and ML fields.
