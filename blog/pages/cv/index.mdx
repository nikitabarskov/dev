## Summary

I am a software engineer based in Oslo, specializing in data analysis and 
machine learning. I hold a master's degree in Computer Science and 
Data Analysis, as well as a bachelor's degree in Applied Physics and 
Mathematics.

Throughout my career, I have primarily worked as a full-stack data 
specialist, gaining more than six years of experience in various 
industries, including programmatic advertisement, oil and gas, retail
and agriculture. 

I am well-versed in a wide range of technologies and approaches:

- DevOps and ML Ops: I have experience working with the Analytics Platform 
  Team, enabling data scientists and data analysts while adopting the Data 
  Mesh approach.
- Public Cloud: My primary focus has been on Google Cloud Platform and Azure,
  utilizing an Infrastructure as Code approach with Terraform for services such
  as GKE, Cloud Run, Azure Container Apps, and Azure Functions.
- Data engineering: I have expertise in data modeling using protobuf, building
  data pipelines in Python, transforming data with dbt, and serving data through
  analytical databases like BigQuery and Snowflake.
- Software engineering: I have designed and developed APIs using gRPC and OpenAPI, 
  as well as services using Python and Scala.
- Data analytics and analysis: I excel in analyzing data and delivering machine 
  learning models.

I am always seeking challenging and rewarding opportunities to leverage my expertise
in product development. I prioritize staying up-to-date with the latest developments
and best practices in the data, software engineering and ML fields.
