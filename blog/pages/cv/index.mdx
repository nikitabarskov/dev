# Curriculum Vitae

## Summary

Hi, my name is Nikita. I am a data engineer originally from Russia and
I have been living permanently in Oslo since September 2019.

Most of my experience is related to work as a combined Data Engineer
and Data Scientist positions. I've set up and maintained several projects
required as a data engineering part with data modelling and actual coding of
data pipelines and configuring data storage, and as a data science
role with data exploration, designing models, doing experiments,
and packaging models into a production solution.

I love to work with data, focus on solving relevant problems,
and deliver maintainable solutions, satisfying business requirements.
I am passionate about studying and eager to learn new things for myself.

I am focused on finding pragmatic and rational solutions to the problem,
flexible in communication, critical and responsible for the work I do,
understand the importance of team working and analysis of feedback.

## Experience

### Data Engineer @ Coop Norge

April 2021 - now

I am working as a full-time Data Engineer on the Data Platform at [Coop Norge].

### Data Engineer / Data Scientist @ Rystad Energy

September 2019 - March 2021

I was a part of the Technology Team at [Rystad Energy]. I had many challenges
during my period of work at Rystad Energy. In addition to having to maintain
legacy code and applications, I was also involved in the development
of new services:

- [ShaleWellCube Satellite Data]: I developed a data pipeline for ingesting and
  analysing satellite images of shale wells.
- [VesselCube]: I set up the system to ingest raw marine traffic data available
  and design storage for it.
- [EmissionCube]: I set up an ELT pipeline to make flaring data available in our
  systems.
- [Covid-19 Public Report]: I participated in many ad-hoc analyses.

### Data Engineer / Data Scientist @ Inventale

September 2017 - August 2019

I was a part of the inventory forecast team of [Inventale] product.
My primary responsibility was to find a solution to improve the quality
of the inventory forecast.
I developed and implemented an algorithm for predicting users'
interactions with advertising content. The algorithm needed
quality assessment tools. I also created a forecast analysis service
for our client analysts, so they can always check the forecast metrics
as required.

### Intern @ Cxense

April 2017 - September 2017

I worked in the [Cxense DMP] product development team as an intern.
My main focus was to learn production-grade development practices by
participating in designing APIs and developing services and
batch processing pipelines.
