# Curriculum Vitae

## Summary

I am a software engineer based in Oslo, specialising in data, 
data analysis and machine learning.

I am working at Coop Norge as a Data Engineer now.

## Background

In my career, the majority of the time, I worked as a full-stack
data specialist. 

I've contributed to several products that required various skill
sets and capabilities from me as an engineer and as a data scientist.
I have experience of

- modelling the data,
- building underlying infrastructure for data,
- doing exploratory data analysis,
- selecting and developing ML models,
- delivering ML models to production.

I hold a master's degree in Computer Science and Data Analysis
and a bachelor's degree in Applied Physics and Mathematics.

I am incredibly excited about data and the modern approaches
to managing it and creating value. The recent trends in
the industry, like Data Mesh, MLOps and DataOps,
inspire me a lot, and these approaches are the future.

I am focused on finding pragmatic and rational solutions to
the problem, flexible in communication, critical and responsible
for the work I do. I understand the importance of team working
and feeback.
