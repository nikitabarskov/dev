# Nikita Barskov, Data and ML Engineer

You can reach me via email [nbarskov@proton.me](mailto:nbarskov@proton.me)
or [nbarskov@duck.com](mailto:nbarskov@duck.com) in English, Norwegian or
Russian.

## Summary

I am a software engineer based in Oslo, specialising in data,
data analysis and machine learning.

I hold a master's degree in Computer Science and Data Analysis
and a bachelor's degree in Applied Physics and Mathematics.

In my career, the majority of the time, I worked as a full-stack
data specialist.

I have five and half years of experience in different industries:
programmatic advertisement, oil and gas, and retail.
I am familiar with a wide range of technologies and approaches:

-   Dev- and ML- Ops: I have experience working at the Analytics Platform Team,
    enabling data scientists and data analysts and adopting the Data Mesh,
-   Public Cloud : I primarily worked with Google Cloud Platform and
    partially Azure using Infrastructure as Code with Terraform,
-   Data engineering: data modelling (I used protobuf), consuming (I wrote
    pipelines in Python), transforming (I used dbt) and serving (via analytical
    database such as BigQuery),
-   Data analytics and analysis: I've been analysing the data and delivering
    machine learning models.

I always seek challenging and rewarding opportunities to leverage my expertise in product development.

I am focusing on staying up-to-date with the latest developments and practices in the data and ML fields.

## Experience

I was a part of the Technology Team at [Rystad Energy][rystad-energy].
I had to maintain legacy code and applications and develop a new set of services, pipelines and models.

I developed pipelines and storage to consume and serve satellite
images of shale wells. I created a model to forecast emissions
based on the flaring data. I designed cost-efficient storage
for marine traffic data and created a service to serve this data.

_Technology stack:_ on-premise, Ansible, BitBucket, PostgreSQL, Prometheus, dbt, Python.

### Data Engineer / Data Scientist @ Inventale

I was a part of the inventory forecast team of [Inventale][inventale] product.
My primary responsibility was to find a solution to improve the quality
of the advertisment inventory forecast.

I developed and implemented an algorithm for predicting users'
interactions with advertising content. In addition, I also created
a forecast analysis service for our client analysts, so they can
always check the forecast quality.

_Technology stack:_ on-premise, Mesos, Hadoop, DC/OS, Prometheus,
MySQL, Python, Scala.

### Intern @ Cxense

April 2017 - September 2017

I worked in the [Cxense DMP][cxense-dmp] product development team as an intern.
