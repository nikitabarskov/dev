## Background

I've contributed to several products that required various skill
sets and capabilities from me as an engineer and as a data scientist.
I have experience of

-   modelling the data,
-   building underlying infrastructure for data,
-   doing exploratory data analysis,
-   selecting and developing ML models,
-   delivering ML models to production.

I am incredibly excited about data and the modern approaches
to managing it and creating value. The recent trends in
the industry, like Data Mesh, MLOps and DataOps,
inspire me a lot, and these approaches are the future.

I am focused on finding pragmatic and rational solutions to
the problem, flexible in communication, critical and responsible
for the work I do. I understand the importance of team working
and feeback.
